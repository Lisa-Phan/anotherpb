**Note on running an NEB job with ORCA**

At the simplest state, ORCA takes in input from 2 xyz file of the 
following format

"""
atom_count
comment
C 000 000 100
H 000 000 100 
"""

Input and output coordinate should be optimized prior to the run
For the situation where multiplicity for spin at the iron center are different, 
perform the run at two different multiplicity and look at where the intersection might be
along the images
