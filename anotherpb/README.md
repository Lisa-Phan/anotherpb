Mini script to create files for simulation runs
This is mainly a series of patchwork scripts to help generate
parameter files for CP2K equilibration, using MCBP amber files
and non-bonded metal parameterization protocol

Require installation of conda ambertools to use MCPB 

**Usage note**   
At the current stage, the error handling of the script is minimal. 

The .sh file serves mostly as a mean to keep track of commandlines 
and data transformation that are otherwise manually retyped/require manual
adjustment in the original protocol. 

* Not an automated pipeline at the moment
* Each new job would require modification of the script and several manual steps
* Input/output should always be checked with a graphic visualizer

**Understanding input files**
These are variables in the run_mc.sh file
  
 + ***INPCRD_FILE***: AMBER type file generated by H++ server, containing 3D atom coordinate
 + ***PRMTOP_FILE***: AMBER type file generated by H++ server, containing atom name and other info
 + ***ORI***: The original PDB that is submitted to H++, containing
1. The complete protein chain
2. The metal ions
3. Substrate, water, and all other things of interest in the active site environment
 + ***RESI_TO_MAKE_MOL2***: The PDB of residues that need custom parameterization (ligand, metal, water)
